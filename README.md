Introducing Evomark - the ultimate framework for working with AIGC models in python. With Evomark, you can control your AIGC workflow by writing python code that evolves through feedback from humans. This dynamic interaction between the model and human feedback allows for more accurate predictions and streamlined workflow. Evomark has several important considerations, including caching whenever possible to save the number of API calls, ensuring everything happens in one place to eliminate the need for copy and paste, and making it easy to provide human feedback. Evomark is the perfect tool for any data scientist looking to enhance their AIGC workflow and improve their results.
