Here are the books written by M. Foucault:

# Discipline and Punish

Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison is a groundbreaking work by French philosopher Michel Foucault. Published in 1975, the book explores the history of punishment and the evolution of the prison system in Western society. Through his meticulous research, Foucault presents a powerful critique of the traditional notions of justice and punishment and argues that the prison system is not a modern invention, but rather the result of a longstanding desire for societal control over individuals. Drawing on historical examples such as public executions and torture, as well as contemporary cases of criminal justice and prisons, Foucault reveals how power operates in society, tracing the ways in which the prison has become central to contemporary society. Discipline and Punish remains a groundbreaking exploration of the mechanisms of power and the history and functionality of punishment in the modern world.

# The History of Sexuality

The History of Sexuality by Michel Foucault is a groundbreaking book that revolutionized the way we think about sex, its practices, and its social, cultural and political implications. Written in 1976, the book presents a historical overview of sexuality from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the modern era, tracing the development of sexual practices, norms, and identities over time.

Foucault argues that sexuality is not an innate, biologically determined aspect of human existence, but rather a social construct that is historically contingent. He challenges the notion that sexual behavior is dictated by natural instincts, and instead suggests that it is shaped by the historical and cultural discourses surrounding it.

Drawing on extensive research into the archives of sexology and other fields, Foucault demonstrates how sexuality has been treated as a source of moral and social control throughout history, but also how it has been subverted and resisted by various groups and individuals.

The History of Sexuality is a seminal work that has inspired countless debates and discussions across a range of disciplines, from sociology and psychology to gender studies and cultural studies. It remains a powerful and provocative read, offering a critical and nuanced perspective on one of the most fundamental aspects of human existence.
